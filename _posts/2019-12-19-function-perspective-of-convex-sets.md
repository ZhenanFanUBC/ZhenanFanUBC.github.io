# Function Perspective of Convex Sets: Introduction to Gauge and Support Functions

Understanding the geometric structure of convex sets is always a challenging topic in convex analysis. In this post, I will introduce two set-related functions: gauge function and support function, which provide function perspectives of convex sets. Most of the theoretical results here can be found in [^1] and [^2]. Throughout the post, let $C$ be a closed convex set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing the origin in its interior.

## Gauge Function
**Definition** The gauge function with respect to the set $C$ is defined as 
$$\gamma_C(x) := \inf\{\lambda\geq 0 \mid x \in \lambda C\}.$$ 
For completeness, we set $\gamma_C(x) = \infty$ if there is no $\lambda > 0$ such that $x \in \lambda C$.

The geometric interpretation for the gauge function is that $\mu = \gamma_C(x)$ is the amount that the set $C$ must be expanded or shrunk to include a query point $x$. The next proposition shows some nice properties of the gauge function.

**Proposition** 
* (Bijection) $C = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \gamma_C(x) \leq 1\}$
* (Scaling) Let $\alpha$ be a positive number, then $\gamma_{\alpha C} = \frac{1}{\alpha}\gamma_{C}$;
* (Linear transformation) Let $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a linear operator, then 
$$\gamma_{C}(\Phi \cdot) = \gamma_{\Phi^{-1}C}(\cdot),$$
where $\Phi^{-1}C$ is the pre-image of $C$;
* (Sum of sets) Let $C_1, \dots, C_k$ be closed convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing the origin in their interiors, then 
$$\gamma_{C_1 + \dots + C_k}(x) = \gamma_{C_1}\diamond\dots\diamond\gamma_{C_k}(x):=\inf\{\max\{\gamma_{C_1}(x_1), \dots, \gamma_{C_k}(x_k)\} \mid x_1 + \dots + x_k = x\},$$
 where $\diamond$ is called polar convolution. A more detailed discussion over polar convolution can be found in [^3].

## Support Function
**Definition** The support function with respect to the set $C$ is defined as 
$$\sigma_C(z) := \sup\{\langle c,z \rangle \mid c \in C\}.$$

Geometrically, the support function is trying to find the element in $C$ that is most aligned with the query direction $z$. The next proposition shows some nice properties of the support function.

![Support]({{ "/assets/img/post1/support.png" | relative_url }})

**Proposition** 
* (Bijection) $C = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \langle x,z \rangle \leq \sigma_C(z), \forall z \in \mathbb{R}^n\}$;
* (Scaling) Let $\alpha$ be a positive number, then $\sigma_{\alpha C} = \alpha\sigma_{C}$;
* (Linear transformation) Let $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a linear operator, then 
$$\sigma_{C}(\Phi \cdot) = \sigma_{\Phi^{*}C}(\cdot),$$
where $\Phi^{*}$ is the adjoint operator of $\Phi$;
* (Sum of sets) Let $C_1, \dots, C_k$ be closed convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing the origin in their interiors, then 
$$\sigma_{C_1 + \dots + C_k}(z) = \sigma_{C_1}(z) + \dots + \sigma_{C_k}(z).$$

## Relationship Between Gauge and Support Functions
As we showed before, both gauge function and support functions can be used to construct a closed convex set. Therefore, unsuprisingly, gauge and support functions are closely related, and this relationship is often called polarity. Before describing the relationship, I will first introduce the notion of polar set.

**Definition** The polar set of $C$ is defined as 
$$C^{\circ} = \{c^{\circ} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \langle c^{\circ},c \rangle \leq 1, \forall c \in C\}.$$

Geometrically, the polar set $C^{\circ}$ is obatined by cutting the polar of the cone generated by $C \times \{1\}$ at the level $-1$. The next proposition shows the relationship between gauge and support functions.

![Polar]({{ "/assets/img/post1/polar.png" | relative_url }})

**Proposition**
The gauge and support functions are polarly related, i.e.
* $\gamma_C = \sigma_{C^{\circ}}$;
* $\sigma_C = \gamma_{C^{\circ}}$.

## Subdifferential of Gauge and Support Functions
Subdifferential of a general convex function can be viewed as the local property of the function. When specialied to gauge and support functions, the subdifferentials reflect the local property of the convex sets $C$ and $C^{\circ}$. I will first introduce an important set-valued function, which describes the facial structure of a convex set.

**Definition** The face of $C$ exposed by direction $d$ is defined as 
$$\mathcal{F}_C(d) = \{c \in C \mid \langle c,d \rangle = \sigma_C(d)\}.$$

Geometrically, the face of $C$ exposed by direction $d$ is all the points in $C$ that are most aligned with $d$. The next proposition describes the subdifferentials of gauge and support functions.

![Face]({{ "/assets/img/post1/face.png" | relative_url }})

**Proposition** The subdifferentials of gauge and support functions are given by
* $\partial\gamma_C = \mathcal{F}_{C^{\circ}}$;
* $\partial\sigma_C = \mathcal{F}_C$.
