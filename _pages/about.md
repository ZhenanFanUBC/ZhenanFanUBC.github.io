I am a PhD student in the optimization group of the Department of Computer Science at University of British Columbia. My supervisor is Prof. [Michael P. Friedlander](https://friedlander.io){:target="\_blank"}.

I am interested in developing algorithms for optimization problems arising in machine learning, compressed sensing and operation research.
