I am Zhenan Fan, a PhD student in the Computer Science department of The University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, Canada. I am interested in developing algorithms for optimization problems arising in machine learning, compressed sensing and operation research. 

This blog contains some notes and discoveries in optimization related research areas. You can know more of me from my personal [webpage](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~zhenanf/).
